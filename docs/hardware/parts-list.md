# PiTrac DIY Parts List

This document provides a comprehensive list of all components needed to build a PiTrac launch monitor.

{: .highlight }
ðŸ“‹ **Before ordering parts**, check the [Roadmap](../getting-started/roadmap.md) to understand which version you should build and any recent updates to hardware requirements.

## Computing Hardware

| Quantity | Hardware | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| 1 | [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/) and power supply, 4 GB minimum, 8 GB recommended | Getting a bundled kit with the Pi and power supply can be economical if you don't have Pi-related components yet |
| 1 | [DEPRECATED] ~~Raspberry Pi 4 Model B~~ | The current version of PiTrac requires only a single Pi 5. The "Single-Pi" version is relatively new but appears to be working well |
| 1 | [Pimoroni NVMe Base for Raspberry Pi 5 - PIM699](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5845) (optional, but recommended) | Allows use of NVMe memory drive instead of MicroSD card. Alternative: [Geekworm M901](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CQ4D2C9S/) |
| 1 | [NVMe SSD drive](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BGFRZDTB/) (optional, but recommended) | M.2 M key edge connector, 2230/2242 form factors. Recommend at least 256 GB capacity |
| 2 | Micro SD cards (64GB recommended) | To bootstrap the Pi's |
| 1 | Active Cooler fan for Pi 5 (optional) | Recommended if doing large compiles on the Pi |

| 2 | [6mm 3MP Wide Angle Lens](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4563) | For Pi GS cameras (which come without lenses) |
| 1 | [1" x 1" IR Longpass Filter](https://www.edmundoptics.com/p/1quot-x-1quot-optical-cast-plastic-ir-longpass-filter/5421/) (1.5mm thickness) | Blocks visible light below ~730nm. **Important:** Must allow 730nm IR light through |
| 1 | [60/120 Degree LED Lens - 44mm + Reflector](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XK7QTV5) | Focuses the infrared light. Consider getting both 60Â° and 120Â° lenses |
| 1 | [100W COB IR LED Chip - 730nm](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DNRT2R4) | **Must be 730nm** for proper IR strobe operation |
| 1 | [USB COB LED Strip Lights - 6.56FT](https://www.amazon.com/Aclorol-Powered-Daylight-Flexible-Backlight/dp/B0D1FYV3LM/) | For lighting the teed-up ball. **Must produce NO infrared light** |
