**Important Notes:**
- IR filter must allow 730nm light through (not 850nm filters)
- LED strip must produce NO infrared light
- Verify all IR components are compatible with 730nm wavelength
- Check [Roadmap]({% link getting-started/roadmap.md %}) before ordering to ensure you're building the right version
