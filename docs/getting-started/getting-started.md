# Getting Started

Welcome to PiTrac! This section will help you understand what PiTrac is, where the project is headed, and how to get involved.

PiTrac is an open-source DIY golf launch monitor that uses Raspberry Pi computers and cameras to track golf ball launch speed, angles, and spin in three dimensions.
