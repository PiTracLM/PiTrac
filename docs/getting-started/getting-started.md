# Getting Started

Welcome to PiTrac! This section will help you understand what PiTrac is, where the project is headed, and how to get involved.

PiTrac is an open-source DIY golf launch monitor that uses Raspberry Pi computers and cameras to track golf ball launch speed, angles, and spin in three dimensions.

## What you'll find here:

- **[Introduction](introduction.md)** - Learn what PiTrac is and what makes it special
- **[What is PiTrac?](what-is-pitrac.md)** - Understanding the philosophy behind the project
- **[Roadmap](roadmap.md)** - Current status and future plans
- **[Contributors](contributors.md)** - Acknowledgments and attributions

Once you're familiar with the project, you can move on to the [Hardware](../hardware/) section to start planning your build.
