### PiTrac - The DIY Golf Launch Monitor

- As seen on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/195042-pitrac-the-diy-golf-launch-monitor)
- Also on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Golfsimulator/comments/1hnwhx0/introducing_pitrac_the_open_source_launch_monitor/)

The PiTrac project is a fully-functional golf launch monitor that avoids the need for expensive high shutter-speed and high frame-rate cameras. We've developed techniques for high-speed, infrared, strobe-based image capture and processing using cameras such as the Pi Global Shutter camera (~US$50 retail) and Raspberry Pi single board computers.

PiTrac determines ball speed, launch angles, and spin in 3 axes. Its output is accessible on a stand-alone web app. Interfaces to popular golf-course simulators including GsPro and E6 are working. 2k/TopGolf never responded to our requests.
