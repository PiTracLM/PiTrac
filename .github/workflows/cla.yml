            Thanks for your PR! Before we can review it, please sign our Contributor License Agreement.

            **How to sign (right here in this PR):**
            1. Read the CLA: $pathToCLADocument
            2. Add a new PR comment with exactly this line (copy & paste):
               ```
               ${{ env.SIGNATURE_PHRASE }}
               ```
            3. Already signed and not seeing the check pass? Ask me to recheck by commenting:
               ```
               ${{ env.RECHECK_PHRASE }}
               ```

          custom-pr-sign-comment: ${{ env.SIGNATURE_PHRASE }}

          custom-allsigned-prcomment: "All contributors have signed the CLA. Thanks!"
