**Description:**

The Case Cover is the output protective (and aethetic) case that surrounds the inner component tower of the PiTrac version 2 enclosure.  The Case Cover consists of two parts - a Lower Half and an Upper Half.  This part separation is to allow the cover to printed on most standard-size 3D printers. The top part of the Case Cover also acts as a way of easily picking up the entire PiTrac unit.
A [FreeCAD 1.0](https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php) compatible parameterized model is included here along with .stl files.

**Printing Notes:**

PLA works well for this, but PETG probably would as well. 

Recommended print settings: 2 perimeter layers, 15% infill, grid or rectilinear infill patterns, custom painted-on supports (see the Prusa Slicer .3mf file for where the supports are needed). Both upper and lower halves require glue-stick glue on the printer bed and we recommend a 7mm brim assist because of the very small print base surface.
You'll want to paint on supports and support-exclusions so that the only places with support on the upper half of the case are the three rectangular holes that provide access to the Compute Board.

**Assembly Notes:**

See the [main assembly instructions](https://github.com/jamespilgrim/PiTrac/blob/main/Documentation/PiTrac%20Version%202%20Assembly.md).
Ultimately, the two parts will be glued together with something like thick, slower-drying super-glue such as Starbond Gap Filler Thick High Performance Super Glue.
