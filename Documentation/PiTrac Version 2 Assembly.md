**The PiTrac Assembly Guide - Version 2**

Overview:  
This document explains the process of building a typical PiTrac DIY Launch Monitor (LM) using the Version 2 Enclosure and the new PiTrac Compute Board.  This process includes the assembly of all of the physical components, including the 3D-printed parts and hardware, such as cameras and Raspberry Pi computers.  Detailed printing instructions for the 3D parts are contained in the directories that have the respective part files.  Instructions for certain stand-alone sub-assemblies such as the camera mounts are contained in separate documents, but linked to from this main document.  Instructions for the software components of the LM are separate and available [here](https://github.com/jamespilgrim/PiTrac/blob/main/Documentation/Raspberry%20Pi%20Setup%20and%20Configuration.md).

TBD - This is just a placeholder document for now - Please ignore.







New Material for Enclosure 2:
Tower Construction
Screw the M2x6 self-tapping screws into the back plate just far enough so that a little of the tip of the screw goes beyond the other side.
WARNING - These little screws are delicate (especially if carbon steel), so don't over-tighten
The screws will act to help register the back plate and front plate halves of the parts of the tower.
Use thick, slower-drying super-glue such as Starbond Gap Filler Thick High Performance Super Glue to glue the halves together
The tower halves do not always have material in the same places, so take care not to add glue to portions of one half that will not be adjacent to the other half.
NOTE - make sure that the bottoms of the halves (especially for the base parts) are well-registered so that the completed, glued tower will sit and attach flat to the base box.
<PICTURES>
Use clamps judiciously to make sure the parts are glued securely
Tight the screws through the two sides as you work your way up the tower

Shank Shield Installation
2 x Pan head M4*12 or *16 self-tapping screws for the top of the shield (avoid counter-sinking, but could also use flat-head)
2 x flat head self-tapping M4*12 or *14 screws for the bottom of the shield
Put the shield in place and mark where the upper-left hold should be that goes into the top-left riser of the tower frontplate
Drill a hole in the shield using a 5/32" drill bit or something else that is very nearly as wide as the screw threads
WARNING - it's very easy to shatter or chip the shield when screwing in the screws.  For that reason, the holes must be nearly as large (or even larger) than the screws.  This may compromise the rigidity of the lower-shield mount, but better than a cracked shield.
WARNING - Plexiglas or polycarbonite is very sharp.  Make sure you sand everything.
Mount the shield using just the top-left screw.  Using a 1/8" (or other small bit), drill through the sheild in the top-right where tthe shield will mount into the top-right tower riser.  
Drill (straigh) through the two counter-sunk shield-securing holes in the front of the base-box.  The reasons for using the smaller bit is sot that there is enough plastic in the basebox hole to tightly grip the screw.
Unattach the shield, put it on something you can drill into, and drill out the three new holes with a 5/32" drill.
Attach the shield using the four screws listed above.
